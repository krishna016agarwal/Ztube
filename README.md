🎥 ZTube – Build Your Own YouTube-like Application
<br>
<br>
ZTube is the backend of a YouTube-like application, designed to offer video streaming 🎬 and content sharing 📤 capabilities. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), ZTube allows users to upload, view, and share videos, as well as interact with content through comments 💬, likes 👍, and subscriptions 🔔. Whether you're looking to create your own video-sharing platform or integrate video features into an existing app, ZTube provides the perfect foundation to get started.
<br><br>
The backend handles critical features such as video uploading 📥, user authentication 🔑, real-time interactions ⚡, and data storage 🗄️, ensuring smooth performance even as the platform scales. With a focus on scalability and efficiency, ZTube is ready to serve content to thousands (or even millions) of users around the world 🌍. The system is designed to be flexible and supports features like video metadata management 📊, ensuring that every uploaded video is easily searchable and organized.
<br><br>
One of the key aspects of ZTube is its user management system 👥, which supports user registration 📝, authentication (via JWT) 🔐, and roles such as admin ⚙️ and user 🧑‍💻. Admins have the ability to moderate content 🛑, delete inappropriate videos 🗑️, and manage users, ensuring that the platform remains secure 🔒 and user-friendly 🤝. Users can interact with the platform by subscribing to channels 🔔, liking videos ❤️, and commenting 🖊️, making ZTube a truly engaging environment for content creators and viewers alike.

The architecture of ZTube is designed with RESTful API endpoints 🌐, allowing easy integration with frontend frameworks like React ⚛️. Additionally, it uses MongoDB 🗃️ for data storage, making it flexible and scalable for managing video data 🎥 and user-related information 👤. The use of Express.js 🚀 for the server-side logic and Node.js 🟢 for non-blocking asynchronous operations ensures that the application can handle high concurrency ⚡, making it well-suited for large-scale deployments 📈.
